Changes in FLTK 1.4.0					Released: ??? ?? 2017

  General Information about this Release

  - FLTK 1.4.0 is based on FLTK 1.3.4 (released Nov 15 2016),
    see CHANGES_1.3 for more information.

  - CMake is the primary supported build system in FLTK 1.4.0 and later.
    CMake can be used to generate Makefiles, IDE project files, and
    several other build systems by using different "generators" provided
    by CMake (for instance Ninja, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, KDevelop3, etc.).
    See README.CMake.txt for more information.

  - autoconf/configure is still supported by the FLTK team for backwards
    compatibility with older systems that lack CMake support.
