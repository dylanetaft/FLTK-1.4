Changes in FLTK 1.4.0                                   RELEASED: ??? ?? 2017

  New features and extensions

    - CMake is the primary supported build system in FLTK 1.4.0 and later.
      CMake can be used to generate Makefiles, IDE project files, and
      several other build systems by using different "generators" provided
      by CMake (for instance Ninja, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, KDevelop3, etc).
      See README.CMake.txt for more information.
      autoconf/configure is still supported by the FLTK team for backwards
      compatibility with older systems that lack CMake support.


  New configuration options (ABI version)
    
    - FLTK's ABI version can be configured with 'configure' and CMake.
      See documentation in README.abi-version.txt.

  1.4.0 ABI FEATURES

    - None. 1.4.0 is a new ABI version (breaking 1.3.x ABI).
