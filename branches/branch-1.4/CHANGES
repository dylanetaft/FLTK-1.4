Changes in FLTK 1.4.0					Released: ??? ?? 2017

  General Information about this Release

  - FLTK 1.4.0 is based on FLTK 1.3.4 (released Nov 15 2016),
    see CHANGES_1.3 for more information.

  - CMake is the primary supported build system in FLTK 1.4.0 and later.
    CMake can be used to generate Makefiles, IDE project files, and
    several other build systems by using different "generators" provided
    by CMake (for instance Ninja, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, KDevelop3, etc.).
    See README.CMake.txt for more information.

  - autoconf/configure is still supported by the FLTK team for backwards
    compatibility with older systems that lack CMake support.


  New Features and Extensions

  - New method Fl_Tabs::tab_align() allows to set alignment of tab labels,
    particularly to support icons on tab labels (STR #3076).
  - Added '--enable-print' option to configure effective under X11 platforms
    and with 'yes' default value. Using '--enable-print=no' removes print
    and PostScript support from the FLTK library, thus reducing its size.
  - Added Fl_Surface_Device::push_current(new_surface) and
    Fl_Surface_Device::pop_current() to set/unset the current surface
    receiving graphics commands.
  - X11 platform: Added support for drawing text with the pango library
    which allows to draw most scripts supported by Unicode, including CJK
    and right-to-left scripts. The corresponding CMake option is
    OPTION_USE_PANGO. The corresponding configure option is --enable-pango.
    This option is OFF by default.

  New Configuration Options (ABI Version)

  - FLTK's ABI version can be configured with 'configure' and CMake.
    See documentation in README.abi-version.txt.


  1.4.0 ABI FEATURES

  - None. FLTK 1.4.0 has a new ABI, breaking 1.3.x ABI.


  Other Improvements

  - (add new items here)
  - Separated Fl_Input_Choice.H and Fl_Input_Choice.cxx (STR #2750, #2752).
  - Separated Fl_Spinner.H and Fl_Spinner.cxx (STR #2776).
  - New method Fl_Spinner::wrap(int) allows to set wrap mode at bounds if
    value is changed by pressing or holding one of the buttons (STR #3365).
  - Fl_Spinner now handles Up and Down keys when the input field has
    keyboard focus (STR #2989).
  - Renamed test/help.cxx demo program to test/help_dialog.cxx to avoid
    name conflict with CMake auto-generated target 'help'.
  - Many documentation fixes, clarifications, and enhancements.
