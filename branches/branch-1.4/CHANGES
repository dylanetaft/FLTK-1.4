Changes in FLTK 1.4.0					Released: ??? ?? 2017

  General Information about this Release

  - FLTK 1.4.0 is based on FLTK 1.3.4 (released Nov 15 2016),
    see CHANGES_1.3 for more information.

  - CMake is the primary supported build system in FLTK 1.4.0 and later.
    CMake can be used to generate Makefiles, IDE project files, and
    several other build systems by using different "generators" provided
    by CMake (for instance Ninja, CodeBlocks, Eclipse, KDevelop3, etc.).
    See README.CMake.txt for more information.

  - autoconf/configure is still supported by the FLTK team for backwards
    compatibility with older systems that lack CMake support.


  New Features and Extensions

  - (add here)
  - Added '--enable-print' option to configure effective under X11 platforms
    and with 'yes' default value. Using '--enable-print=no' removes print
    and PostScript support from the FLTK library, thus reducing its size.
  - Added Fl_Surface_Device::push_current(new_surface) and
    Fl_Surface_Device::pop_current() to set/unset the current surface
    receiving graphics commands.

  New Configuration Options (ABI Version)

  - FLTK's ABI version can be configured with 'configure' and CMake.
    See documentation in README.abi-version.txt.


  1.4.0 ABI FEATURES

  - None. FLTK 1.4.0 has a new ABI, breaking 1.3.x ABI.


  Other Improvements

  - (add here)
  - Many documentation fixes, clarifications, and enhancements.
